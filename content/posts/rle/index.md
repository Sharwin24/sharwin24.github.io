The Jackal is a simple differential drive robot with an impressive payload capacity and can be equipped with various sensors. In this project, we simulated the jackal with a 3D LiDaR (Velodyne VLP16) in Mujoco and setup a PPO pipeline to teach the mobile robot to navigate towards a goal and avoid obstacles.
