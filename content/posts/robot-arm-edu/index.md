An educational kit designed to teach the fundamentals of kinematics and dynamics. The kit is intended to accompany the course ME3460: Robot Dynamics & Control at Northeastern University. The kit is a physical representation of the final project, which is currently done purely through MATLAB simulation.

## Kit Design
The entire kit is composed of 3D printed parts, and off-the-shelf hardware/electronics. Students can assemble the kit without any soldering and with minimal tools.
